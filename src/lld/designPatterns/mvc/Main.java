        MVC - is architecture, View is frontend part and it just past the request
        to controller basically no logic is here
        Model gets the requirement from controller and asks DB (DB layer and no logic)
        controller - is intermediate and has all the logic (it is the brain)

        As design pattern, you implement controller(service) and model(POJO)
        As in pod opta m
